Questions with explainations
============================

1. What is a server?
   A server is a computer or system that provides resources, services, or data to other computers,
   known as clients, within a network. It responds to requests from clients, facilitating communication, data storage,
   or other specific functions in a networked environment
 
2. What is the role of the domain name?
   The role of a domain name is to serve as a human-readable, alphanumeric label that represents a specific IP address on
   the internet. It provides an easy way for users to access websites, email services, or other online resources without
   needing to remember numerical IP addresses.

3. What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?
   The "www" in "www.foobar.com" typically corresponds to a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record.

4. What is the role of the web server?
   The web server's role is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (web browsers), process these requests, and
   deliver web content (such as HTML pages, images, or other resources) to the clients over the internet.

5. What is the role of the application server?
   The application server's role is to execute and manage business logic, handle application-specific operations, and
   facilitate communication between the web server and backend databases or other services in a web application.

6. What is the role of the database?
   The database's role is to store, manage, and organize data in a structured format, allowing for efficient retrieval,
   modification, and manipulation of information in response to application or user requests

7. What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
   The server communicates with the user's computer using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure version, HTTPS, over the Internet.

= Issues with using a single web server, single application server, single database, and a single code base =
=============================================================================================================

i.	A Single Point of Failure (SPOF) is a critical component in a system or network that, if it fails, leads to the entire system's failure.
	There are a lot of single points of failures starting from having one server that contains only one web server, application server, and database.

ii.	Downtime when maintenance is needed (like deploying a new code web server
	needs to be restarted); The downtime period might be longer than expected because the server is dependent on one
	code base which at that moment, isn’t available. Users will therefore not be able to access the website and its contents
	which results in a bad user experience and loss of traffic.

iii.	Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic; The domain name points directly at the server hence doesn’t contain a load
	balancer which allows handling increased load easier. This poses an issue to the volume of users trying to access the website’s content
        and can lead to poor user experience or rather set a limit to the number of users the website will be able to accommodate.
