**Postmortem**

**Issue Summary:**
On February 22, 2024 by the hour of 3:00 PM, an outage occurred in our mail server.

Duration: The outage occurred from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM (PST) on February 22, 2024.
Impact: The outage affected our email service, resulting in a complete inability for 20% of our users
to send or receive emails. Users reported error messages indicating connection failures and delays in email delivery.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a hardware failure in one of the mail server's
storage disks, leading to data corruption and service disruption.

**Timeline:**

- 3:00 PM (PST): Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sharp increase in email delivery failures.
- Actions taken: Engineers initiated investigation, suspecting a possible server or network issue.
- 3:15 PM: Initial investigations focused on server performance metrics and network connectivity.
- Misleading paths: Initial assumption leaned towards network congestion or DNS issues.
- 3:30 PM: Issue escalated to the infrastructure team for further analysis.
- 4:00 PM: Engineers identified hardware failure in one of the mail server's storage disks as the root cause.
- 4:30 PM: Affected disk was replaced, and data recovery process initiated.
- 5:00 PM: Service restored, and email functionality resumed for all users.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- Root Cause: Hardware failure in one of the mail server's storage disks caused data corruption and service disruption.
- Resolution: Affected disk was replaced, and data recovery process was initiated to restore service functionality.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Regular hardware inspections and proactive replacement of aging components.
  - Implementation of redundant storage systems to minimize the impact of hardware failures.
  - Enhanced monitoring to detect early signs of hardware degradation.

- Tasks:
  1. Schedule regular hardware inspections for all critical systems.
  2. Implement redundant storage systems for mail servers to improve fault tolerance.
  3. Enhance monitoring system to provide alerts for hardware failures and degradation.
  4. Conduct training sessions for engineers on hardware maintenance and replacement procedures.

In conclusion, the email service outage on February 22, 2024, was caused by a hardware failure in
one of the mail server's storage disks. Through proactive measures, including regular hardware inspections,
implementation of redundant storage systems, and enhanced monitoring, we aim to prevent similar incidents
in the future and ensure the reliability of our email service for all users.
